      <p class="text font" id="tribute-info">Mrs. Ocran was loved by all of the nursing staff within Jacobi Hospital NYCHHC. She had the innate ability to make a room spark with joy,
        along with being able to track down anyone who was missing any of their occupational education; especially PMCS. Mrs. Ocran was the first person
        many of us within the Behavioral Health Service began their training with, and was a veteran nurse in the field of Psychatric Nursing.
        <br>
        The joy and laughter that she gave to her cohorts in Jacobi will be greatly missed.</p>
