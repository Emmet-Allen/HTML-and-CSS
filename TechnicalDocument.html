    <p>JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity
        to your website(for example, games, responses when buttons are pressed
        or data is entered in forms, dynamic styling, and animation...etc).
        This article helps you get started with this exicting language and
        gives you and idea of what is possible.

                <h2>What is JavaScript, really?</h2> </header>
            <p>JavaScript ("JS" for short) is a full-fledged dynamic programming language that, when applied to an HTML
                document, can provide dynamic interactivity on websites. It was invented by Brendan Eich, co-founder of
                the Mozilla project, the Mozilla Foundation, and the Mozilla Corporation.

                JavaScript is incredibly versatile and beginner friendly. With more experience, you'll be able to create
                games, animated 2D and 3D graphics, comprehensive database-driven apps, and much more!

                JavaScript itself is fairly compact yet very flexible. Developers have written a large variety of tools
                on top of the core JavaScript language, unlocking a vast amount of extra functionality with minimum
                effort. These include:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Browser Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) — APIs built into web browsers, providing
                    functionality like dynamically creating HTML and setting CSS styles, collecting and manipulating a
                    video stream from the user's webcam, or generating 3D graphics and audio samples.</li>
                <li>Third-party APIs — Allow developers to incorporate functionality in their sites from other content
                    providers, such as Twitter or Facebook.</li>
                <li>Third-party frameworks and libraries — You can apply these to your HTML to allow you to rapidly
                    build up sites and applications.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Because this article is only supposed to be a light introduction to JavaScript, we are not going to
                confuse you at this stage by talking in detail about what the difference is between the core JavaScript
                language and the different tools listed above. You can learn all that in detail later on, in our
                JavaScript learning area, and in the rest of MDN.<br>
                Below we will introduce you to some aspects of the core language, and you'll also play with a few
                browser API features too. Have fun!</p>
        </section>


        <section class="main-section">
            <header id="A Hello world! example"> <h2>A "Hello world!" example</h2> </header>
            <p>The above section might sound really exciting, and so it should — JavaScript is one of the most lively
                web technologies today, and as you start to get good at using it, your websites will enter a new
                dimension of power and creativity.

                However, becoming comfortable with JavaScript is a little harder than becoming comfortable with HTML and
                CSS. You may have to start small and keep working in small consistent steps. To start, we'll show how to
                add some basic JavaScript to your page, creating a "Hello world!" example (the standard in basic
                programming examples).</p>
            <ol>
                <li>First, go to your test site and create a new folder named scripts. Then, within the new scripts
                    folder you just created, create a new file called main.js. Save it in your scripts folder.</li>
                <li>Next, in your <code>index.html</code> file enter the following element on a new line just before the
                    closing
                    <code>/body</code> tag: <br>
                    <code> script src="scripts/main.js" /script </code></li>
                <li>This is basically doing the same job as the <code> link </code> element for CSS — it applies the
                    JavaScript to the page, so it can have an effect on the HTML (along with the CSS, and anything else
                    on the page).
                </li>
                <li>Now add the following code to the <code>main.js</code> file:
                    <code>const myHeading = document.querySelector('h1');
                    myHeading.textContent = 'Hello world!';
                </code>
                </li>
                <li>Finally, make sure the HTML and JavaScript files are saved, then load index.html in the browser. You
                    should see something like the following:</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Your heading text has now been changed to "Hello world!" using JavaScript. You did this by first using a
                function called <code>querySelector()</code> to grab a reference to your heading, and store it in a
                variable called
                <code>myHeading</code>. This is very similar to what we did using CSS selectors. When you want to do
                something to an
                element, you need to select it first.

                After that, you set the value of the <code>myHeading</code> variable's <code>textContent</code> property
                (which represents the
                content of the heading) to "Hello world!".</p>

                Language basics crash course</header>

            <p>Let's explain some of the core features of the JavaScript language, to give you a better understanding of
                how it all works. It is worth noting that these features are common to all programming languages, so if
                you master these fundamentals, you're well on your way to being able to program just about anything!</p>

            <h3>Variables</h3>
            <p>Variables are containers that you can store values in. You start by declaring a variable with the
                <code>var</code>
                (less recommended, dive deeper for the explanation) or the let keyword, followed by any name you want to
                call it:<code> let myVariable; </code></p> <br>

            <p>After declaring a variable, you can give it a value:
                <code>myVariable = 'Bob';</code><br>
                You can do both of these operations at the same time:
                <code>let myVariable = 'Bob';</code>
                <code>myVariable = 'Steve' ;</code>

                <p>Note that variables may hold values that have different data types.</p>
            </p>

        <section class="main-section">
            <header id="Supercharging our example website"> <h2>Supercharging our example website</h2> </header>
            <p>Now we've gone over a few JavaScript basics, let's add a few cool features to our example site to see
                what is possible.</p>

            <h3>Adding an image changer</h3>
            <p>In this section, we'll add an additional image to our site using some more DOM API features, using some
                JavaScript to switch between the two when the image is clicked.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>First of all, find another image you'd like to feature on your site. Be sure it is the same size as
                    the first image, or as close as possible.</li>
                <li>Save this image in your <code>images</code> folder.</li>
                <li>Go to your <code>main.js</code> file, and enter the following JavaScript. (If your "Hello world!"
                    JavaScript is still there, delete it.)</li>
                <li>Save all files and load <code>index.html</code> in the browser. Now when you click the image, it
                    should change to the other one!</li>
            </ol>

            <p>You store a reference to your <code>img</code> element in the <code>myImage</code> variable. Next, you
                make this variable's
                <code>onclick</code> event handler property equal to a function with no name (an "anonymous" function).
                Now, every
                time this element is clicked:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>You retrieve the value of the image's <code>src</code> attribute.</li>
                <li>You use a conditional to check whether the src value is equal to the path to the original image:
                </li>
                <ol>
                    <li>If it is, you change the <code>src</code> value to the path to the 2nd image, forcing the other
                        image to be loaded inside the <code>img</code> element.</li>
                    <li>If it isn't (meaning it must already have changed), the <code>src</code> value swaps back to the
                        original
                        image path, to the original state.</li>
                </ol>
            </ol>

            <h3>Adding a personalized welcome message</h3>

            <p>Next we will add another bit of code, changing the page's title to a personalized welcome message when
                the user first navigates to the site. This welcome message will persist, should the user leave the site
                and later return — we will save it using the Web Storage API. We will also include an option to change
                the user and, therefore, the welcome message anytime it is required.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>In <code>index.html</code>, add the following line just before the <code>script</code> element:</li>
                <br>
                <code> button Change user /button </code>
                <li>In <code>main.js</code>, place the following code at the bottom of the file, exactly as written —
                    this takes
                    references to the new button and the heading, storing them inside variables:</li><br>
                <code>let myButton = document.querySelector('button');
                        let myHeading = document.querySelector('h1');</code>
                <li>Now add the following function to set the personalized greeting — this won't do anything yet, but
                    we'll fix this in a moment:</li><br>
                <code>function setUserName() {
                    let myName = prompt('Please enter your name.');
                    localStorage.setItem('name', myName);
                    myHeading.textContent = 'Mozilla is cool, ' + myName;
                  }</code>
                <p>This function contains a <code>prompt()</code> function, which brings up a dialog box, a bit
                    like<code> alert()</code>. This
                    <code>prompt()</code>, however, asks the user to enter some data, storing it in a variable after the
                    user presses
                    OK. In this case, we are asking the user to enter their name. Next, we call on an API called
                    <code>localStorage</code>, which allows us to store data in the browser and later retrieve it. We
                    use
                    <code>localStorage</code>>'s <code>setItem()</code> function to create and store a data item called
                    <code>'name'</code>, setting its value
                    to the <code>myName</code> variable which contains the data the user entered. Finally, we set the
                    <code>textContent</code> of
                    the heading to a string, plus the user's newly stored name.</p>
                <li>Next, add this if ... else block — we could call this the initialization code, as it structures the
                    app when it first loads:</li><br>
                <code>if(!localStorage.getItem('name')) {
                        setUserName();
                      } else {
                        let storedName = localStorage.getItem('name');
                        myHeading.textContent = 'Mozilla is cool, ' + storedName;
                      }</code>
                <p>This block first uses the negation operator (logical NOT, represented by the !) to check whether the
                    <code>name</code>> data exists. If not, the <code>setUserName()</code> function is run to create it.
                    If it exists (that is, the
                    user set it during a previous visit), we retrieve the stored name using <code>getItem()</code> and
                    set the
                    textContent of the heading to a string, plus the user's name, as we did inside
                    <code>setUserName()</code>.</p>
                <li>Finally, put the below <code>onclick</code> event handler on the button. When clicked, the
                    <code>setUserName()</code> function
                    is run. This allows the user to set a new name, when they wish, by pressing the button:</li><br>
                <code>myButton.onclick = function() {
                        setUserName();
                      }</code>
            </ol>

            <h3>A user name of null?</h3>
            <p>When you run the example and get the dialog box that prompts you to enter your user name, try pressing
                the <i>Cancel</i> button. You should end up with a title that reads "Mozilla is cool, null". This is
                because
                when you cancel the prompt, the value is set as <code>null</code>, a special value in JavaScript that
                basically
                refers to the absence of a value.</p><br>
            <p>Also try just pressing OK without entering any name — you should end up with a title that reads "Mozilla
                is cool,", for fairly obvious reasons.</p>
            <p>you wanted to avoid these problems, you could check that the user hasn't entered <code>null</code> or a
                blank name by
                updating your <code>setUserName()</code> function to this:</p><br>
            <code>function setUserName() {
                    let myName = prompt('Please enter your name.');
                    if(!myName || myName === null) {
                      setUserName();
                    } else {
                      localStorage.setItem('name', myName);
                      myHeading.innerHTML = 'Mozilla is cool, ' + myName;
                    }
                  }</code>
            <p>In human language — if has <code>myName</code> no value, or its value is <code>null</code>, run
                <code>setUserName()</code> again from the start.
                If it does have a value (if the above statements are not true), then store the value in
                <code>localStorage</code> and
                set it as the heading's text.</p>
